# Casual shooter game
This is a  simple game of a space shooter ship developed in unity.

## The concept
This is a very simple game with only three game play levels.
I have however tried to make it a bit harder to win by establishing harsh conditions.

## How to play the game:
1. The game has three levels.
2. Level 1 has 5 enemy ships, level 2 with 6, and finally level 3 with 7.
3. At each level, you are given one more bullet than the number of enemy ships. 
4. You should use your bullets wisely because the number of bullets is extremely important otherwise you lose! It is important to note that in real life if you run out of bullets, you maynot defeat your enemies and the chances of dying are high.
5. For bullets recharge however, you have to take up the golden ring given off by every enemy which you shoot down. This ring will give you an extra bullet recharge.
6. The game offsets an alarm when you are left with only 3 bullets (so that you know that bullets are important, please don't lose due to no of bullets!)
7. The game also gives you only 3 chances. When you are killed 3 times you lose!
##### Note that when you are killed, your player ship respawns (is reset) in 3 seconds only and only if your lives are greater than zero.  You are however not resistant to the bullets, even after respawning you can die again immediately if hit again. I did this to make it hard for you to win the game.
8. To advance to another level, you have to kill all the enemy ships at that level until you are done 
9. You will lose the game in two ways: First; when you have zero bullets and also when your lives i zero.
10. You move your space shooter ship using the arrow keys or (W-A-S-D) keys on the keyboard

## Good to know!
1. Don't let your bullets run out (get to zero)!
2. If you can, always recharge (you take up the golden ring that comes from killing an enemy to recharge).
3. You get an extra score when you recharge, and also when you advance to another level: 50 points for advancing to level 2, 100 when you advance to level 3 and 200 when you complete level 3 (When you win)

### LET'S GAME!!!! ENJOY!!!
